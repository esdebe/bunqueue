/**
 * Memory Leak Fix Verification Tests
 *
 * Issue: eventsManager.ts:56-82
 * Previously, when waitForJobCompletion() timed out, the waiter was marked as cancelled
 * but never removed from the completionWaiters map. If the job never completed,
 * the cancelled waiter would stay in memory forever.
 *
 * FIX: The timeout handler now removes the waiter from the array and cleans up
 * empty arrays from the map.
 *
 * These tests verify the fix works correctly by:
 * 1. Creating multiple waiters that timeout
 * 2. Verifying the waiters are removed from memory after timeout
 * 3. Confirming memory stays stable over time
