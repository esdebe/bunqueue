/**
 * WriteBuffer Data Loss Bug Tests
 *
 * Bug: The double-buffer swap design in flush() creates data loss scenarios:
 *
 * 1. stopGracefully() timeout: When flush takes longer than timeout, jobs
 *    are silently lost. resolve(-1) is called but no callback reports which
 *    jobs were lost. The buffer is marked stopped, jobs are gone forever.
 *
 * 2. stop() with persistent errors: When flush() throws during stop(),
 *    the error is caught and swallowed (line 294). Jobs remain in buffers
 *    but buffer is marked stopped. No callback reports the lost jobs.
 *
 * 3. Double-buffer swap window: Between buffer swap (line 182-183) and
 *    successful write (line 188), if the process exits, jobs in flushBuffer
 *    are lost. While crash data loss is expected for buffered mode, the
 *    swap design makes error recovery harder than necessary.
 *
 * These tests FAIL before the fix, PASS after.
